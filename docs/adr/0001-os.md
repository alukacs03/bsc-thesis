# ADR-0001: Choice of Operating System
Date: 2025-09-18  
Status: Accepted

## Context
The platform requires a Linux distribution that is stable, open source, secure by default, and fully supports both advanced networking (WireGuard, FRR/OSPF) and Kubernetes components. The operating system choice sets the baseline for reproducibility and long-term support throughout the thesis.

## Options
| OS            | Pros                           | Cons                          |
|---------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Debian 12     | Stable, mature, familiar, wide package support | Earlier upgrade horizon |
| Debian 13     | Newest packages, long runway   | Recently released, less proven |
| Ubuntu 24.04  | LTS, good K8s ecosystem        | Defaults differ, less personal experience |
| CentOS Stream | Rolling updates, RHEL ecosystem| Not stable, unpredictable cadence |
| Rocky Linux   | RHEL-compatible, stable        | Limited personal experience   |

## Decision
**Chosen distro: Debian 12 (old-stable)**

## Rationale
- Personally well-understood and used daily.  
- Mature and widely supported; proven stability in production.  
- Comprehensive package support for WireGuard, FRR, kubeadm, containerd.  
- Safer than adopting Debian 13 immediately after release.

## Consequences
- OS upgrade will be needed sooner (Debian 12 support ends before 13).  
- In return, project gains maturity, familiarity, and lower integration risk, which outweighs the shorter lifecycle.
